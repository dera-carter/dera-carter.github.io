      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
         Hello! I am Dera Carter, a detailed and results-driven student with a drive to improve and succeed.
         With a commitment to excellence and a keen eye for detail, I strive to make a meaningful impact in every
         project I work on. I show particular interest in technology, textile projects, and a love for technical
         theater and the behind the scenes of stage performances. When it comes to technology, I prefer the hands on
         aspect of the work. I like working with the physical components of the computer, knowing how the parts
         function and having a final working product. Understanding how to take a computer apart is very rewarding to
         me, and I like fixing computers and troubleshooting their issues. For example, I work an internship for my
         highschool as a Chromebook tech, taking chromebooks from students experiencing issues, finding the issue and
         repairing it back to functionality (or in some cases replacing the device completely).
         Textile projects are a personal hobby of mine, ranging from mending clothes to making costumes. Working with
         my hands is very enjoyable to me, and having an outlet for my creativity that results in something that can
         be worn is incredible to me. One of my projects includes a handmade quilted pillow as a gift for someone
         important to me. Cutting out the fabric and using a sewing machine to assemble the pillow is a long, but
         enjoyable process.
         Finally, my favorite (and only) extracurricular is technical theater. I am not one for stage performing, but
         I love working backstage in order to make the story come to life. Whether it be working with backstage
         props, working flywall for fly pieces, costume designs, project management or assembling set sand furniture,
         I enjoy working to make the show have an exemplary final product.
